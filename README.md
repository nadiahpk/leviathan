# Leviathan

## Overview

Inspired by Gross et al. (2015; Scientific Reports) and Sigmund et al. (2010; Nature),
this code is about allowing every possible strategy to evolve in a public goods game,
where strategies involve both a decision about cooperating/defecting in the PGG,
and also who to vote for in a pool of punishers based upon their punishment criteria.

A recent paper -- Garcia and Traulsen (2019; J. R. Soc. Interface) -- contains some similar ideas to
what I was aiming for.
